# What is this?

This is the repository of my blog, [treszkai.github.io](treszkai.github.io).

The `source` branch contains the source files, and the `master` branch contains the generated site.

Generate production website (e.g. with Google Analytics) with `rake prod`.

Thank you, GitHub, for hosting it for free! <3
