## Machine Learning Practical

A two-semester course taught by Steve Renals about deep learning at the University of Edinburgh.

[Coursework 2](/files/2017-11-mlp-cw2.pdf) was about different learning rules (SGD, Adam, RMSprop), batch normalisation, and convolutional nets on EMNIST.

## Informatics Research Review

My [IRR](/files/2018-01-irr.pdf) at the University of Edinburgh, where I collected literature on noise-contrastive estimation, negative sampling, and generative adversarial nets, and aimed to give a fair comparison of these methods, while trying to give a citation for every statement I make.
