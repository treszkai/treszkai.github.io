When we take facts for granted, we stop questioning why they these facts should be true in the first place. And I find that few people use the mental label of "this statement can be derived from facts I already know from independent sources".

I experienced a big mental shift when I realized that I don't have to "believe" anything when it comes to mathematics: every "true" statement is either an axiom, or could be derived from axioms.
