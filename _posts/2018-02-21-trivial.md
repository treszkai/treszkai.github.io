When we take facts for granted, we stop questioning why they these facts should be true in the first place. And I find that few people use the mental label of "this statement can be derived from facts I already know from independent sources".

I experienced a big mental shift when I realized that I don't have to _believe_ anything when it comes to mathematics: every "true" statement is either an axiom, or could be derived from axioms. (At least, that is a more sensible definition of "trueness" than "whatever the professor said".)

Compare that with high-school mathematics. Students learn De Morgan's laws, but nobody questions them because the teacher said that it's true and they seem to be true. Students learn the formula for solving a quadratic equation, but only a few teachers explain why it gives the correct result, or what happens when the discriminant is negative. Their knowledge tree consists primarily of leaves, with few connections between topics, so students rely on rote learning, so no wonder that math is a scary topic for most.

This mindset often persists through university and beyond. _Obviously_, the sum of two normally distributed random variables is a random variable – but how many of us are aware that the proof of this "obvious" fact involves the convolution of the two probability density functions?

This post is a reminder to question the statements we're told, an homage to those who make me think, and a thank you note to every one of my math teachers.

_Top chart:_ the pdf of a Gaussian r.v. _X_ with mean -1 and standard deviation 1 in solid blue, a Gaussian r.v. _Y_ with mean 3 and standard deviation 2 in solid red, and the r.v. of _z–Y_ in dashed red (which happens to be also Gaussian).

_Middle chart:_ the product of the pdfs of _X_ and _z-Y_.

_Bottom chart:_ the pdf of the r.v. _X+Y_. This is the convolution of the pdfs of _X_ and _Y_, i.e. for every value of _z_ the area under the product of pdfs _X_ and _z-Y_. **Hint:** move the mouse over this chart to change the value of _z._
