This page links to a few courseworks that I submitted during my academic career.

## Mathematical logic

I had the fortune to study classical logic from [László Csirmaz](http://www.renyi.hu/~csirmaz/) at the Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest. Although I was not officially enrolled in the course, he was kind enough to mark my weekly homework regardless of my lack of student status. These were originally written in Hungarian, and I translated a few of them into English.

 - [Coursework 4, Exercise 4](/files/2017-03-logic-cw4ex4.pdf), about a non-standard structure of Robinson arithmetics.
 - [Coursework 9, Exercise 1](/files/2017-05-logic-cw9ex1.pdf), a result similar to the diagonal lemma in first order logic.

When proving Gödel's completeness theorem during the lectures, I missed a crucial step from the proof, so I [proved it myself](/files/2017-07-logic-henkin.pdf).

## Machine Learning Practical

A two-semester course taught by Steve Renals about deep learning at the University of Edinburgh.

[Coursework 2](/files/2017-11-mlp-cw2.pdf) was about different learning rules (SGD, Adam, RMSprop), batch normalisation, and convolutional nets on EMNIST.

## Informatics Research Review

My [IRR](/files/2018-01-irr.pdf) at the University of Edinburgh, where I collected literature on noise-contrastive estimation, negative sampling, and generative adversarial nets, and aimed to give a fair comparison of these methods, while trying to give a citation for every statement I make.
