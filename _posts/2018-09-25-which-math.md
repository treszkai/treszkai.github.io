title: "Pure math or applied math major for AI alignment research?"
description: My opinion on whether one should choose a major in pure math or in applied math if I want to do AI alignment research.

I think what matters most is how much you could _excel_ in either field (relative to your classmates, or potentially internationally), and which way your math department is oriented.

Basically, you can learn the basics of any field from online courses and textbooks, and what the university gives you is personal access to PhD students and professors. These people could discuss your personal interests with you when deciding for a PhD topic, or write a recommendation letter if you worked with them, and it's reassuring to know that the person handing you knowledge is one of the best.

Some diversification certainly helps, to give you a broader perspective and well-rounded knowledge, for insurance (“_Stats? Sure, of course I know what an average CS student knows_”), and to learn about yourself (to know how much you'd enjoy working on applied problems).

Your studies are going to shape the approach you take in alignment, and while today's research is more on the applied side, the high-level cognitive skills (such as abstract reasoning, or coming up with novel ways of looking at problems) are probably better learned in pure math. There are examples of people from many fields going into technical AI alignment research, but as a math student, you'll definitely not be lost. I also recommend [this piece of advice from Andrew Critch](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7uJnA3XDpTgemRH2c/critch-on-career-advice-for-junior-ai-x-risk-concerned): keep an eye out for fooling yourself.
