Hi, my name is Laszlo Treszkai.

Currently I'm doing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, with an interest in statistical machine learning, natural language understanding, deep learning.

Previously I earned an [MSc in Electrical Engineering](https://www.mit.bme.hu/eng/) at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, with a focus on embedded systems, where I worked with the [BME Formula Racing Team](frt.bme.hu) in the [Formula Student](https://www.formulastudent.de) competition. After that, I worked as an embedded engineer at [TTControl](ttcontrol.com) on the HY-TTC 500 ECU, which is used in big and slow vehicles like tractors and snow groomers and such.
