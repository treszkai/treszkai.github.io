Hi, my name is Laszlo Treszkai.

Currently I'm doing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. I want to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human interests -- for more on this topic, see the [TED talk of Sam Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nt3edWLgIg), read the articles of Tim Urban ([part 1](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) and [part 2](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html)), listen to an [interview with Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaNLX71Hl88), or check out the research of the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/research-areas/#1513087763365-e148efe6-2d23) or the [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://intelligence.org).

Previously I earned an [MSc in Electrical Engineering](https://www.mit.bme.hu/eng/) at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, with a focus on embedded systems, where I built a race car in the [BME Formula Racing Team](frt.bme.hu) for the [Formula Student](https://www.formulastudent.de) competition. After university, I worked as an embedded engineer at [TTControl](ttcontrol.com) on the HY-TTC 500 ECU, which is used for safety critical applications in big and slow vehicles like tractors and snow groomers. Then I realized that while embedded engineers are necessary for stopping global warming and getting to Mars and saving lives in a myriad ways, the field of AI safety is way more neglected in comparison. Given that it is [the survival of the human race that is at stake](https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html), I figured that my work on AI alignment would have a higher marginal impact.
