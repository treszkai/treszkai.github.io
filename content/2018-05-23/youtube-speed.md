# Premise

While the UI of YouTube only shows only limited set of high-speed options, it is possible to set the speed to any floating point value. Even better, one can do so from their favorites bar with bookmarklets.

# Method

Simply add any of the following code snippets as bookmarks.

If you have a fixed speed in mind, e.g. 2.5:

`javascript:document.getElementsByTagName("video")[0].playbackRate=2.5;`

Or save this line to show a prompt that asks for a floating-point input:

`javascript:var%20speed=prompt("Speed:","1.");document.getElementsByTagName("video")[0].playbackRate=parseFloat(speed);`

Which results in the following prompt:

# Caveats

Works with YouTube and Vimeo.

The speed display in the video player will remain to show the last setting.
